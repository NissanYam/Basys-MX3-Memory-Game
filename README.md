# Basys-MX3-Memory-Game
This project was programmed on a "BASYS MX3", during "Embedded systems" course.

Memory Game:

steps:
  1. Switch 0 - turn on game
  2. Chose level between 1 - 9 : This defines how many stages the player                                      will have to go through to win

The game starts with 4 characters that the player has to remember, after a certain time the characters will be removed from the screen and the player while running backwards must reproduce the characters that appeared.
As the player progresses in the game, more characters will appear and the time will decrease.
At each stage the player succeeded the green light will flash before moving on to the next stage.
If the player fails the red light flashes and the player has to pick up switch1 and the game restarts.
If the player has passed all the stages the blue light will light up and the player will have to tap 1 to play again.
